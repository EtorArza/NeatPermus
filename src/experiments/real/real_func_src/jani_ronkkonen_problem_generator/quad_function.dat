Example input file for generating a function of the quadratic function family.

Lines:

1. The function family we want to use. 1 means the quadratic family and you should 
	not change this value here. See other example input files
	for information about using the other function families.

2. Screen output level: 
	1: No output, except errors to stderr (cause the function to exit)
	2: Only initialization related outputs
	3: Full screen output (default value)

3. D, Dimension of the problem (0<D<=DMAX, default 2)

4. Seed for random number generator. Default: seed taken from time

5. Controls the shape of the generated optima (both local and global). 
	Value 1 allows different width for each dimension
	value 2 means that each optimum is also randomly rotated
	Any other value means that all optima are of equal width (circle shape) 

6. Amount of Global optima, default 1
	
7. Amount of local optima, default 0

8. The minimum euclidean distance between two global optima. The value must be
	between MINDISTLOW and MINDISTUP (defined in quadratic.c). MINDISTLOW is 
	the default value.

9. Lower and upper limit for the optimum objective function values of local minima. 
	Must be between DIVLOWL and DIVUPL(defined in quadratic.c), which are also the 
	default values. A value for each local optima is randomly generated in this range. 
	A single value means that all local optima will share the same optimum value. 
	Note: when using large shapes and lot of optimas, high upper limit may cause problems 
	in initialization phase, since shallow local optima are tricky to place in growded 
	space such that they are not shadowed by some other optima.

10. Lower and upper limit for the shape of the global optima. A value for each dimension 
	is randomly generated in this range. A single value means that the optima is a 
	round shape. The value nust be between MINSHAPE and MAXSHAPE (defined in quadratic.c), 
	which are also the default values. 
	Note: using too large value for upper limit with 
	large amount of optima and/or shallow local optima may cause problems in initialization 
	phase, because local optima may be tricky to place in crowded space such that they are not
	shadowed by some other optima.

11. Lower and upper limit for the shape of the local optima. A value for each dimension 
	is randomly generated in this range. A single value means that the optima is a 
	round shape.The value nust be between MINSHAPE and MAXSHAPE (defined in quadratic.c), 
	which are also the default values.
	Note: using too large value for upper limit with 
	large amount of optima and/or shallow local optima may cause problems in initialization 
	phase, because local optima may be tricky to place in crowded space such that they are not
	shadowed by some other optima.

To use default values, just type -1 for any of the lines.
